# On Minimizing the Impact of Dataset Shifts on Actionable Explanations

The supplementary material provided here contains two code-bases
that are largely overlapping but have not yet been merged.

For the fine-tuning/retraining experiments from sections 4.1/4.2:

To reproduce HELOC/Adult results for synthetic noise,
launch the appropriately named notebooks in the "synthetic_experiments" folder (this folder).
The notebooks here contain example plots using the same code that generated
the results in the paper, though the code is currently set to run
just one base model trial, to allow easier replication of results.

To reproduce WHO dataset results for temporal shift, please
follow the README instructions in the root folder.
